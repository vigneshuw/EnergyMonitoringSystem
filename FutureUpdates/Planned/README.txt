eMMC Memory
============

The plan is now to use the H7 chip that has a very high clock rate and can support the eMMC memory at a much higher clock rate (read and write speeds)

Advantages
----------

Something that we might potentially use for our case

1. Dual Core
2. Ethernet port is present
3. eMMC interface
4. USB present - Can be used as a mass storage as well
5.
